# vis145a project
# This is the midterm project for vis145a.
# This is a project that acts like asimulator of the Geisel Library, but would actually pop up many windows appeared in zoom. I was inspired by this malware when i was looking through the Malware Museum -https://archive.org/details/malware_TECHNO.COM. I want to use this project to convey the sense of feeling when i have to take online courses for almost a year at the pandemic period.
